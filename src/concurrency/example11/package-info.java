 * Exercise 11: (3) Create a class containing two data fields, and a method that manipulates
 those fields in a multistep process so that, during the execution of that method, those fields
 are in an "improper state" (according to some definition that you establish). Add methods to
 read the fields, and create multiple threads to call the various methods and show that the
 data is visible in its "improper state." Fix the problem using the synchronized keyword.
