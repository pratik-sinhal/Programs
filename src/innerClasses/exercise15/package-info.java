 * Exercise 15: (2) Create a class with a non-default constructor (one with arguments) and
 no default constructor (no "no-arg" constructor). Create a second class that has a method
 that returns a reference to an object of the first class. Create the object that you return by
 making an anonymous inner class that inherits from the first class.
