 * Exercise 25: (2) Create two interfaces and a class that implements both. Create two
 generic methods, one whose argument parameter is bounded by the first interface and one
 whose argument parameter is bounded by the second interface. Create an instance of the
 class that implements both interfaces, and show that it can be used with both generic
 methods.
